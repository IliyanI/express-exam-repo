# Team Manager

A server-side rendered site I did for a Express course.
This is how it should look when logged in as admin. [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/OWxnkmh)

## Features

In this project I used:
 - Express
 - passport.js  for authorization functionality
 - Handlebars for html templating
 - MongoDb for database
